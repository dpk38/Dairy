IoT Project on Automation in Small scale Milk and Cold Storage Industry 
(i) To monitor and rectify temperature and Pressure in Homogenisers. 
  Pressure and Temperature play a vital role in Homogenisation of milk. Any deviations from optimum temperature and pressure affects the process. The existing system required manual monitoring. We theorised an IoT based solution to automate this process by incorporating a temperature sensor and viscometer to monitor these parameters. Any deviation from optimum benchmarks are relayed to the system, and sounds an alarm for rectification. 
(ii) To maintain optimal temperatures in Cold Storage Systems. 
  Cold Storages are used to store Volumes of milk and milk products either in warehouses or for transsportation. Temperature fluctutation lead to spoilage and wastage of product. Frequent opening and closing, or improper closing of door increases the temperature of the storage. We use a temperature sensor to monitor temperature and relay it to systems. Any increase in temperature over long periods of time is detected and rectified. 
Technology Stack: IoT Modules - Arduino Uno, Temperature sensor, Ethernet Card or Wifi module, Viscometer. 
Progamming: C/C++
