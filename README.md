IoT integration in dairy farms

Homogenisation of milk - Optimum pressure and temperature are crucial in ideal homogenisation of milk. The better the process is carried out, the more uniform the curd is set. The current existing system requires manual monitoring of the mechanism and instruments. An IoT based solution was theorised to automate this process by incorporating a temperature sensor and viscometer to monitor these parameters. Deviations from the standard benchmarks are relayed to the system, and sounds an alarm for rectification. 

Mantaining optimal temperatures in Cold Storage Systems - Cold Storages are used to store Volumes of milk and dairy products for preservation. Temperature fluctutations lead to their spoilage. Frequent opening and closing, or improper closing of door increases the temperature of the storage. We use a temperature sensor to monitor temperature and relay it to systems. Any increase in temperature over long periods of time is detected and rectified. 

Technology Stack: IoT Modules - Arduino Uno, Temperature sensor, Ethernet Card or Wifi module, Viscometer. 
Progamming: C/C++
